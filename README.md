# Windows11BootBackupv2
Windows Boot backup script.. enhanced.. basically back up all the "boot stuff" for a faster restore compared to a full image

Ideally boot into something like EaseUS Partition Manager , which sort of looks like windows.. to get over any boot loops where it wastes time only to say "BOOT_DEVICE_NOT_ACCESSIBLE" and that light blue screen with boot options such as reboot to safe mode with networking, rather then a boot repair option.


Bitlocker is not supported.
